Python scripts for Cellranger and RNA velocity (Velocyto to make loom files -> scVelo to calculate RNA velocity) analyses

*master_cellranger.py was used to run raw 10X scRNA-seq data sequentially. 
Run "python master_cellranger.py --help" to see options

*master_velocyto.py was used to make loom files w/ spliced and unspliced counts using velocyto.
Run "python master_velocyto.py --help" to see options
Visit http://velocyto.org to install velocyto package and dependecies.

*run_scvelo.res0.3.py was used to infer RNA velocity using scVelo.
UMAP coordinations were extracted from the Seurat object along with malignant cluster information.
