Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revealed important insights into the heterogeneity of malignant cells. However, sample-specific genomic alterations often confound such analysis, resulting in patient-specific clusters that are difficult to interpret. Here, we present a novel approach to address the issue. By normalizing gene expression variances to identify universally variable genes, we were able to reduce the formation of sample-specific clusters and identify underlying molecular hallmarks in malignant cells. Our results demonstrate the utility of this approach for analyzing scRNA-seq data and suggest avenues for further exploration of malignant cell heterogeneity.
